#### Routing to NSDQ and on a different timer for efficiency

These two triggers were not going off properly, as the unrealized_pl.entry_pl was not being accurately calculated in real-time.
* procPL_2()
* procPL_21()
   
account[self.symbol].unrealized_pl.entry_pl>self.__class__.plUnrlRTE

account[self.symbol].unrealized_pl.entry_pl<-self.__class__.plUnrlRTE

#### EXAMPLE OF CURRENT PRICE METHODOLOGY IN OUR INTERNAL SYSTEM.
* CURRENT PRICE = 2701.72    ??
* MARKET 2704.99 / 2709.03
* LAST PRINT 2709.14
* Does not trigger procPL_2()



### FIXED THIS
* account[self.symbol].position.mtm_price*1.0005<md.L1.bid 
* is closer to the simulated triggers for losses
- Avoids API unrealized P&L (solely) and uses the L1 book as an additional trigger.

#### EXAMPLE OF CURRENT PRICE

The current price in this case was 292.43, represents a loss and does not trigger procPL_2().
- I added > account[self.symbol].position.mtm_price*1.0005<md.L1.bid
- This will now trigger procPL_2() when the md.L1.bid is higher than the entry price by `5bps

Additionally, as a safeguard in the event that the position moves against the market by 10 bps (taking into consideration the bid/ask spread.
- I added > account[self.symbol].position.mtm_price*0.999>md.L1.bid)
- This will now trigger procPL_21() when the entry price is higher than the md.L1.bid by `10bps
